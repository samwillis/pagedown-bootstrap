This is a fork of https://github.com/johnnyZhao/pagedown-bootstrap-i18n to add emotions support

You have to call Markdown.SupportEmotions(imgPath,emotions) before constructing your
editor if your want it to include emotions

The demo is viewable here: http://shellfly.org/pagedown-with-emotions/demo/browser/demo.html

New icons based on http://glyphicons.com/, http://dribbble.com/shots/365544-Mini-glyphs-12-px-Free-PSD and the origional icons.
